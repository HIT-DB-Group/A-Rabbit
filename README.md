# A-Rabbit

This project contains the code for the paper "Attention-based Model for Reliable and Active Benefit Estimation in Index Tuning."

The project is built on top of [Beauty](https://github.com/HIT-DB-Group/Beauty). The main modification is the addition of the `index_selection_evaluation/ML/AE` folder, which contains the core code for the A-Rabbit model.

For detailed usage and implementation, please refer to the individual scripts and the accompanying documentation within the repository.
